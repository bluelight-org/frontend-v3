# Welcome to Bluelight frontend contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started
If you want to start work on this project just follow these steps. 

First of all you should make yourself familiar with the codebase and setup the development environment.
After that you should play arround a little bit with the software to know which component is which view in the frontend. 
Furthermore, implementing something yourself should be the next step. NOTE: Just implement something that comes into your head.
Do not create a PR from it. It is just for getting in touch with the code.


### Issues

Have you found a bug? Do you have a feature request? Just create an issue from the template and get in 
touch with our developers.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/bluelight-org/frontend-v3/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

If you found an issue you want to work on, you will need to make changes. If you implement something make sure 
you follow our folder and code structure we are using. Code that differs from ours might decrease the readability and quality of our code.



### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- Make sure you updated the CHANGELOG.md file in your PR. 
- We need to update and write new tests (unit, e2e) to make sure the application works as it should.
